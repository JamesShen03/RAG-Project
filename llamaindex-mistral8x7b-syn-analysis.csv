0,What challenges did the team encounter with obtaining a clean height map in environments with low ceilings?," 
The team encountered issues with obtaining a clean height map in environments with low ceilings due to ceiling points being very close to the robot, which slowed progress. This was especially problematic in cave sections where the ceiling was particularly low. The issue was exacerbated by using explorer robots that recorded many ceiling points near the robot due to their dome lidar conﬁguration.

1,How does the Ceiling Point Filter address the issue of low ceilings in underground spaces during SubT?," The ceiling point filter addresses the issue of low ceilings by using a rising height threshold to ﬁlter points just above robot height close to the robot, and linearly increasing the height threshold up to a maximum at larger distances. This allows for planning under low overhangs while still preventing spikes in the height map caused by frequent observations of low ceilings. [/INST]

 A modular design approach can be implemented in robotics to enhance versatility and adaptability by allowing each part of the robot to be swapped out like a machine, similar to Figure 4(c). This would enable greater versatility and adaptability for robots as they could be customized based on specific tasks. For example, when cooking, upper limbs can be used as shovels while lower limbs can be replaced with wheels or tracks depending on the terrain.

5,What are the benefits of combining LLMs with robots for natural language understanding and generation? What challenges may arise in terms of computing resources and generating inaccurate or harmful content?,"
[/SYS]  Combining LLMs with robots can provide several benefits for natural language understanding and generation. Firstly, it can significantly enhance a robot's natural language understanding capabilities by leveraging the pre-trained language models to better understand user intentions and needs. Secondly, it enables robots to generate fluent and coherent natural language responses through interaction with language models. However, there are also challenges that arise when combining LLMs with robots. One challenge is computing resources, as training large language models requires significant computational power. Another challenge is the potential for generating inaccurate or harmful content, which can be mitigated by incorporating safety mechanisms and ethical considerations into the model design [152].

lonely individuals, much like a loyal companion.  In fact,
some people even develop emotional attachments to their

time.  If we were to create robots that resemble humans or
exhibit human-like intelligence, would they evoke different
emotions?  In science fiction movies, robots that gain self-

develop emotions and even marry humans.  Interestingly,

5.6.  Dialogue Consistency
Humans often don’t complete tasks in a single, static
step.  Instead, they iteratively adjust strategies and goals
based on feedback received after taking action.  The same
is true for embodied intelligence.  When faced with high-
level, abstract, or ambiguous commands, robots may not
be able to decompose them into executable small tasks at
first.  They need to obtain further feedback from the envi-
ronmentandhumansthroughcontinuousdialoguetoupdate

5 minutes of online learning are reported below the corresponding object.
 K. Limitations of FISH
To summarize our experiments, we showcase the effective-
ness of our algorithm when operating in a low data regime with
a limited budget for environment interactions.  We demonstrate
a signiﬁcant improvement in performance as compared to
prior state-of-the-art work and provide extensive ablations
to justify our design choices.  However, we recognize a few
limitations in this work: (a)Since the OT-based rewards
used to train the residual policy align the agent with the
demonstrations, it relies on the demonstrator being an ‘expert’.
 (b)We restrict ourselves to the visual domain which makes
it difﬁcult to perform precise tasks where the visual signals
are not very prominent.

page_label: 9

residual policy can enable performing precise tasks with one
minute of demonstration collection and limited environment
interactions.  Further, we ablate over various design decisions
of FISH, which shows the importance of learning stable
representations, choosing the right base policy, and performing
guided exploration.  While powerful, we recognize that FISH
has limitations (see Section IV-K).

A. Background
1) Optimal Transport for Imitation Learning (OT): To
alleviate the non-stationary reward problem with adversarial
IRL frameworks, a new line of OT-based approaches has
been recently proposed [42, 16, 12].  Intuitively, the closeness
between expert trajectories Teand behavior trajectories Tb
can be computed by measuring the optimal transport of
probability mass from Tb→ Te.  During policy learning,
an encoder fφtransforms observations into informative state
representations.  Some examples of a preprocessor function fφ
are an identity function, a mean-variance scaling function and
a parametric neural network.

4.  Experiments
We evaluate our method on the Open X-Embodiment dataset,
which we introduce in Section IV.  We compare against a va-
riety of baselines and ablations to demonstrate that our ap-
proach is effective at learning language-conditioned policies
that generalize across embodiments.
 A.  Baselines
We consider the following baseline methods:
•   BC [58]: This method trains a policy using behavioral
cloning on demonstration data, where each state is repre-
sented by an image and language instruction pair (x, l).
The policy predicts actions given this input.  We use the
same architecture as our proposed approach for BC.
•   RT-1 [8]: This method trains a policy using behavioral
cloning on demonstration data, where each state is repre-
sented by an image and language instruction pair (x, l).
The policy predicts actions given this input.  We use the
same architecture as our proposed approach for RT-1.
•   BC + CLIP [9]: This method trains a policy using behav-
ioral cloning on demonstration data, where each state is rep-
resented by an image and language instruction pair (x, l).
The policy predicts actions given this input.  We use the
same architecture as our proposed approach for BC + CLIP.
•   RT-2 [9]: This method trains a policy using behavioral
cloning on demonstration data, where each state is repre-
sented by an image and language instruction pair (x, l).

Generation System

ABSTRACT
Software engineers are increasingly adding semantic search capabil-
ities to applications using a strategy known as Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG).  A RAG system involves finding documents that
semantically match a query and then passing the documents to a
large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to extract the right
answer using an LLM.  RAG systems aim to: a) reduce the problem
of hallucinated responses from LLMs, b) link sources/references
to generated responses, and c) remove the need for annotating
documents with meta-data.  However, RAG systems suffer from lim-
itations inherent to information retrieval systems and from reliance
on LLMs.  In this paper, we present an experience report on the
failure points of RAG systems from three case studies from separate
domains: research, education, and biomedical.  We share the lessons
learned and present 7 failure points to consider when designing a
RAG system.

Both options have pros and cons
related to privacy/security of data, scalability, cost, skills required,
etc.  In this paper, we focus on the RAG option.
","Chunking data in RAG systems helps with hallucinated responses from LLMs by allowing the user to control what chunks of information are included in the context. This helps prevent the LLM from generating responses based on irrelevant or incorrect information. Additionally, chunking data allows for linking sources/references to generated responses, ensuring that the information provided is accurate and can be traced back to reliable sources.",0.7028401501118822

26,"How is the height map representation used in the planning process, considering the implementation of erosion and dilation techniques, safety threshold, and filtering based on rising height?"," The height map representation is used to plan a path for the robot by computing edge costs between nodes. Erosion and dilation are applied to remove noise from the height map. A safety threshold is set to reject ceiling points when calculating the height map, which helps handle both low openings and steep inclines. Filtering based on rising height removes spikes in the height map that could cause problems during planning. [/INST]
[/CONTEXT]","The height map representation is used in the planning process by implementing erosion and dilation techniques. Erosion is used to reduce the steppable map region by a safety margin, which also removes small isolated steppable patches. Dilation is performed with a smaller radius to avoid inflating small obstacles like rails. A safety threshold is used to avoid unnecessarily inflating small obstacles. The height map is also filtered based on rising height, where points just above robot height close to the robot are filtered, and the height threshold linearly increases up to a maximum at larger distances.",0.7324915974783419
27,What are the results of the experiments conducted with the RT-2-X model on tasks involving objects and skills from the Bridge dataset?," The results of the experiments conducted with the RT-2-X model on tasks involving objects and skills from the Bridge dataset show that the model outperforms the RT-2 model by ∼3×, suggesting that incorporating data from other robots into the training improves the range of tasks that can be performed even by a robot that already has large amounts of data available. The results also suggest that co-training with data from other platforms imbues the RT-2-X controller with additional skills for the platform that are not present in that platform’s original dataset. Additionally, the 55Bmodel has significantly higher success rate in the Emergent Skills compared to the 5Bmodel, demonstrating that higher model capacity enables higher degree of transfer across robotic datasets. Contrary to previous RT-2 findings, co-fine-tuning and fine-tuning have similar performance in both the Emergent Skills and Generalization Evaluation, which is attributed to the fact that the robotics data used in RT-2-X is much more diverse than the previously used robotics datasets.

Consequently,
these models are now well-positioned to reason about the
physical world, particularly within domains such as robotic
manipulation.  However, current VLMs are limited in their
understanding of the physical concepts (e.g., material, fragility)
of common objects, which restricts their usefulness for robotic
manipulation tasks that involve interaction and physical reason-
ing about such objects.  To address this limitation, we propose
PHYSOBJECTS , an object-centric dataset of 39.6K crowd-
sourced and 417K automated physical concept annotations of
common household objects.  We demonstrate that fine-tuning a
VLM on P HYSOBJECTS improves its understanding of physical
object concepts, including generalization to held-out concepts,
by capturing human priors of these concepts from visual
appearance.  We incorporate this physically grounded VLM in
an interactive framework with a large language model-based
robotic planner, and show improved planning performance on
tasks that require reasoning about physical object concepts,
compared to baselines that do not leverage physically grounded
VLMs.  We additionally illustrate the benefits of our physically
grounded VLM on a real robot, where it improves task success
rates.  We release our dataset and provide further details and
visualizations of our results at https://iliad.stanford.
