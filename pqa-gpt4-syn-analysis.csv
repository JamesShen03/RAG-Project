The dataset includes 39.6K crowd-sourced and 417K automated physical concept annotations for real household objects. It consists of 117,424 images, 225,466 object bounding boxes, and 4,203 object instance IDs. By fine-tuning VLMs on human data for physical reasoning, casting it as a visual question answering (VQA) problem, the models benefit from generalization abilities and versatility, improving their performance in tasks requiring a deeper physical understanding of the world.  Score: 9 Gao2024 pages 1-2: Fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) using the PHYSOBJECTS dataset enhances its understanding of physical object concepts by incorporating physically grounded annotations of common household objects. This fine-tuned VLM is then utilized in an LLM-based robotic planning framework, where the LLM queries the VLM about physical concepts of objects in the scene before generating a plan. The system achieves improved planning performance on tasks requiring physical reasoning compared to baselines that do not use physically grounded VLMs. The physically grounded VLM also improves task success rates when planning with a real robot.  Score: 9 Gao2024 pages 6-7: Fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) using the PHYSOBJECTS dataset improves physical reasoning in robotic planning tasks. The study shows that the fine-tuned VLM enhances performance on tasks requiring physical reasoning. However, it is noted that the model still makes errors compared to human judgment and lacks grounding in real physical quantities. Future work is suggested to incorporate real physical measurements to enhance grounding. The dataset and methodology presented in the study are considered a step towards using VLMs for more sophisticated reasoning in robotics.  Score: 9 Gao2024 pages 4-4: The excerpt discusses fine-tuning a vision-language model using the PHYSOBJECTS dataset by prompting the model with questions that can be answered with yes or no for continuous concepts. The score function used is ""s(o, c) = p(yes|o, c) / p(no|o, c),"" and the Bradley-Terry model is employed to estimate probabilities based on human preferences. The model is fine-tuned by minimizing a specific objective function. Experimental results evaluate the model\'s performance in physical reasoning tasks and planning accuracy on real scenes.
