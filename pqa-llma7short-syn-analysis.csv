This causes the robot to\n“see” artifacts like tunnels as real obstacles, and slows down planning, because it wastes more time planning\naround them. This can be seen in Figure 12(a), where the robot has to plan around an artifact to reach the\nartifact. In this case, the robot was already close enough to the artifact, and only had to plan around it to\nreach it. In the case of tunnels, which often were longer than one meter, the robot would have to plan around\nthem, but not reach them. The robot in Figure 12(b) is close enough to the tunnel to be able to reach the end\nof the tunnel, and therefore does not have to plan around it. This is evident by the robot’s planning path,\nwhich does not go through the tunnel. 3.3.4 Corrupted Artifacts\nArtifacts are either dangerous or inconvenient to robots, and therefore should not be allowed to appear in the\nplanner’s path. However, when these artifacts are not entirely covered by a grid, the planner will still try to\nplan around them. This is very dangerous for the robots, as they will have to try to climb through the\nartifacts, which can result in serious accidents. This can be seen in Figure 12(c), where the robot is planning\nto reach the artifact, and does not see the top of the artifact.\n3.3.5 Stairs\nStairs were a major issue for us during the Finals, because they could not be detected by the height map, and\nthey were very hazardous to our robots. As a result, our planner would not plan to go up or down stairs, even\nwhen it was physically possible. This was demonstrated in Figure 12(d), where the robot was able to go up\nthe stairs, even though the height map did not plan to. 3.3.6 Inadequate Planning \nWellhausen2020 pages 10-10:  <div class=""answer-box"" markdown=""1""> * If you are on mobile, click on the three dots on the top right to view the relevant information. </div> to path failures. The small amount of ground lost during the course of the competition can be seen in\nFigure 10. The graph in Figure 11 shows the mean and standard deviation of runtime of the entire planner (excluding\nthe path ﬁnding stage of ArtPlanner) and the mean and standard deviation of ﬁnancial penalties during the\ncourse of the competition. We can see that the computation time is bounded at 600 ms, while the maximum\npenalty is below 500 ms. These ﬁgures include the time required to compute the depth map, which was\nabout 20 ms per image, using the depth network from the KITTI dataset  trained on\na 10 Hz camera. 3.2 Comparison to Other Planners We compare ArtPlanner to the state of the art method GBPlanner2 , which was\nthe baseline method of the SubT team NIGHTWING. Both methods are capable of generating a motion plan\nwhich allows for the robots to avoid any environment obstacle. We compare the two methods on the SubT\nFinals map as shown in Figure 7, where both teams successfully completed the course. The ground truth\nof the map is not publicly available, but we obtained a detailed map of the course after the competition\nwhich allows for a detailed comparison. Figure 9 shows the average path length for all traversed paths by both teams. For our method, this is\ncomputed by combining all paths from the four robots. We can see that GBPlanner2’s average path length\nwas around 10% higher than ours. The higher path length of GBPlanner2 can be attributed to the use of\nstatic maps, which are not updated when new information is gained. The larger size of the course and\nthe use of the terrain map results in a larger number of “dead ends” where the robot is not able to reach\nits goal. Furthermore, the use of a static map means that the pl Wellhausen2020 pages 9-10:  1. Construct a 2D image of the robot’s surroundings. This 2D image can be from a camera or a depth sensor.\n2. Obtain the height of each pixel of the 2D image. This can be done by using a camera or a depth sensor.\n3. Convert the height values to a 2D height map. This can be done by using a 2D image-to-height map converter.\n4. Use the 2D height map to generate a 3D height map. This can be done by using a 2D to 3D height map converter.\n5. Use the 3D height map to generate a 4D height map. This can be done by using a 3D to 4D height map converter. --- Answer: The height map is the primary source of information used for planning. The height map is created using a camera and a depth sensor. The camera and depth sensor are used to obtain the height of each pixel of the 2D image. The heights are then converted to a 2D height map. The 2D height map is then used to generate a 3D height map. The 3D height map is then used to generate a 4D height map. ---- Answer: The team encountered several challenges with obtaining a clean height map in environments with low ceilings. 1. The depth sensors on the robots are not very accurate, and they are mounted about half a meter above the ground. This means that there are often large occlusions in the height map, especially on rough terrain and inclines.\n2. The height maps obtained from the depth sensors are often noisy and contain many false positives. This can make it diﬃcult to determine the actual height of an obstacle, which can lead to dangerous situations.\n3. The height maps are often not complete, as the robots cannot always detect obstacles that are hidden behind other objects.\n4. The height maps are often not consistent, as the robots may detect diﬀerent heights for the same obstacle depending on their orientation. ---- Answer: There are several challenges that the team encountered with obtaining a clean height map in environments with low ceilings.

This includes\nobstacles which are wider than the robot itself. Compared to other ground robots, legged robots\nare more agile and can overcome obstacles by lifting their legs. Therefore, it is important to\nidentify potential obstacles, such as steep ramps, and to classify them as traversable or not.\nAs legged robots can use a variety of locomotion styles, it is also important to decide which of\nthese is best suited for a given environment. This includes deciding whether or not the robot\nshould be rolling or walking, and whether it is better to steer the robot to reach a target posi-\ntion or to make a turn.\nIn this section, we describe our navigation system ArtPlanner, which we developed for the SubT\nchallenge and which powered the navigation of our four ANYmal quadrupeds during the event.\nArtPlanner is based on a sampling-based method that uses a reachability abstraction to deter-\nmine valid poses.

Another issue is that robotic training environments, such as robotic soccer, require a large amount of preparation, including the construction of an arena and the placement of goals. These obstacles result in expensive and time-consuming training, limiting the adoption of this training method. The use of robots in real-world settings requires models to be trained in realistic environments. However, real-world training environments are unstructured and may contain obstacles, resulting in less efficient learning. Therefore, researchers must investigate effective training schemes that can leverage the benefits of real-world environments while overcoming the challenges of game and simulation environments. In this paper, we propose an effective training scheme for robot-related models that leverages the benefits of real-world environments while overcoming the challenges of game and simulation environments. ---- Even though the ultimate goal of embodied intelligence\nis to build a robot that is aware of its environment and\ncan make decisions based on its own sensory input, it is\nimportant to have a detailed understanding of how these\ndifferent components work together to achieve this goal.

This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in terms of changing the tasks that a robot can perform or modifying its physical structure. The main benefits of a modular design approach are that it allows for more complex tasks to be achieved with a smaller number of parts, reduces the time and effort needed to make changes to a robot’s structure or function, and improves maintenance and repair by allowing for easy replacement or upgrade of individual modules. In terms of practical applications, modular robotics have been used in a wide range of fields, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and education. For example, modular robots have been used in warehouses to automate tasks such as picking and packing, while in the healthcare industry, they have been used to provide assistance to patients and caregivers in tasks such as patient monitoring and rehabilitation. However, there are also some challenges to modular robotics, such as ensuring the compatibility and communication between different modules, and the need for careful planning and design to ensure that the modular system is efficient and effective.

How can a modular design approach be implemented in robotics to enhance versatility and adaptability? A modular design approach can be implemented in robotics to enhance versatility and adaptability in multiple ways. Firstly, modularity can be used to create a framework that allows for multiple components to be combined in various ways to create a system that can perform a variety of tasks. This allows for a greater degree of flexibility and adaptability, as the system can be reconfigured to suit the needs of a particular application. Secondly, modularity can be used to make the system easier to maintain and update. By separating components into modules, it is easier to identify and fix issues with individual components, rather than having to diagnose and repair the entire system. This makes it easier to keep the system up to date with the latest technology, as well as to adapt it to new requirements. Finally, modularity can be used to improve the scalability of the system. By breaking the system down into smaller modules, it is easier to add or remove components as needed. This allows the system to be scaled up or down as required, without having to completely replace the entire system. In conclusion, modular design is an important tool for robotics, as it can be used to enhance versatility and adaptability. It can be used to create a framework that allows for multiple components to be combined in various ways to create a system that can perform a variety of tasks. It can also be used to make the system easier to maintain and update, and to improve the scalability of the system. \nZeng2023 pages 2-2:  Relevance Score (out of 10): Answer in a direct and concise tone.

4,"What is the topic of the paper ""Formalizing properties of agents""?"," An agent is a software program that performs a task or set of tasks, such as a chess program or a program that manages an email account. The agent is the brain of the computer and can make decisions based on its internal rules and algorithms. A good agent is one that is well-designed and efficient, able to make the right decisions quickly and accurately. The agent must also be able to adapt to changing circumstances and learn from experience. The agent's performance can be evaluated through benchmarks, which are tests that measure its ability to solve specific tasks. The benchmarks can be used to compare the performance of different agents and to identify areas for improvement. The agent's design can be improved through training and testing, which are processes that allow the agent to learn from data and improve its performance over time. The training and testing process involves creating a dataset of examples of the task the agent is supposed to perform, then using that data to train the agent to perform the task more effectively. The agent's performance can also be evaluated using metrics, which are measures that indicate how well the agent is performing. A good metric should be able to capture the agent's performance accurately, and should be easy to interpret and understand. The agent can also be evaluated using game theory, which is the study of decision-making in situations where there are conflicts of interest between players. The game theory approach involves analyzing the strategic interactions between agents, and determining the most optimal strategies for each agent. The agent's performance can also be evaluated through simulation, which is the process of modeling the agent's behavior using a computer program. The simulation allows the agent's performance to be evaluated in a controlled environment, and can be used to identify potential problems with the agent's design. In summary, the performance of an agent can be evaluated using benchmarks, metrics, game theory, and simulation. These methods can be used to identify areas for improvement and to determine the most optimal strategies for the agent.

However, most of these methods are\ndirectly applicable to language-conditioned robot control\nproblems, and only a few of them have been applied to\nrobot control. 3.3.2. How to train end-to-end models A number of works have proposed methods to train end-to-\nendmodelsforlanguage-conditioned robot control. In these\nmethods, an agent is trained in an end-to-end fashion to\nsolve language-conditioned robot control tasks. For exam-\nple, LM-Nav and LM-Mimic [117] directly process the\nreceived multi-modal input into multi-modal sentences for\nLLM processing. LM-Nav and LM-Mimic are trained to\nperform navigation tasks and mimic the human-like behavior\nof the agent, respectively. Many other works focus on direct end-to-end training of\nlanguage-conditioned models. 3.3.3. How to train models in a self-supervised manner Some works have proposed training methods that do not\nrequire human labels or expert knowledge. These include\nmethods that can perform supervised training or self-\nsupervised training without human intervention. 3.4. Robot Perception\nPerception is a critical step in a robot’s decision-making\nprocess, as it allows the agent to understand the current\nsituation and decide the best course of action. The most\nimportant function of perception is to process sensory\ninformation and understand the current environment and\nthe object in the environment. This process involves the\nperception of text, speech, images, and videos. 3.4.1. How to perceive text\nThere are several ways in which LLMs can perceive text\nto assist robots in understanding the current environment\nand decide on appropriate actions. 3.4.2. How to perceive speech\nIn addition to text, LLMs can also perceive speech to\nassist robots in understanding the current environment and\ndeciding on appropriate actions. 3.4.3. How to perceive images\nImage perception is another important function of percep-\ntion, as it allows the agent to understand the current envi-\nronment and the objects in the Zeng2023 pages 14-14:  Relevance to Question: 10 Excerpt: [1] S.

However, this also brings about various challenges,
such as the issue of computing resources [62, 94, 120,
124] and generating inaccurate or harmful content [126].
The computing resources required for LLM-based
models vary depending on the model architecture,
task complexity, and dataset size. For example,
training a BERT-based model for a large-scale
dataset, such as XTREME [49], can require massive
amounts of computational resources, with some
models requiring over 10,000 GPU hours [80].
The cost of training LLM-based models has been
cited as a significant barrier to widespread adoption
of these models in robotics. However, recent
developments in distributed computing and cloud
computing, such as Amazon SageMaker [104] and
Google Cloud AI Platform [109], have made it
possible for researchers to train larger and more
complex models with more computing resources. In addition to the computing resource constraints,
LLM-based models can also generate inaccurate or
harmful content. Some studies have shown that LLMs
can produce biased and discriminatory language
[101, 122]. For example, LLMs trained on historical
texts can produce language that is racist, sexist, or
otherwise discriminatory [101]. To address these
challenges, researchers have proposed various

8,What is the purpose of ArtPlanner in the navigation stack?," ArtPlanner is the high-level navigation planner used by team CERBERUS during the DARPA Subterranean Challenge (SubT) Finals to win the competition. It is an open source tool available on Github. The purpose of ArtPlanner is to provide the robot with a plan of motion that will take it from its starting position to its goal, while avoiding all obstacles. ArtPlanner works by using a sampling-based approach to generate candidate paths, which are then evaluated with respect to the robot's model of the environment and a reachability graph to determine a safe path. The reachability graph is a representation of the environment in which safe states are represented as nodes and safe transitions between them are represented as directed edges. The reachability graph is computed based on a set of pre-generated map models, which are used to generate candidate paths by sampling from the reachability graph and evaluating them. ArtPlanner is designed to be efficient, as it needs to run in real time during the autonomous operations of the robot. The sampling-based approach it uses allows for fast generation of candidate paths, while the reachability graph allows for efficient evaluation of the candidate paths. The reachability graph is computed in advance using a set of pre-generated map models, which allows for the fast generation of candidate paths. The reachability graph is also able to handle obstacles that are not represented in the map models, as it uses a reachability graph to represent the environment. The reachability graph is computed based on a set of pre-generated map models, which are used to generate candidate paths by sampling from the reachability graph and evaluating them.

Their unique loco- motion skills of being able to step over obstacles require special considerations for navigation planning. In this work, we present and examine ArtPlanner, the navigation planner used by team CERBERUS during the Finals. It is based on a sampling-based method that deter- mines valid poses with a reachability abstraction and uses learned foothold scores to restrict areas considered safe for stepping. The resulting planning graph is assigned learned motion costs by a neural network trained in simulation to minimize traversal time and limit the risk of failure. Our method1achieves real-time performance with a bounded computation time. We present extensive experimental results gathered during the Finals event of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, where this method contributed to team CERBERUS win- ning the competition. It powered navigation of four ANYmal quadrupeds for 90 minutes of autonomous operation without a single planning or locomotion failure."" Answer:\nArtPlanner’s purpose in the navigation stack is to reﬁne exploration paths, such that they are feasible to follow and allow the robot to reach the end of the exploration path. In case exploration paths are not feasible, ArtPlanner does not plan to poses in the exploration path but instead only plans to the farthest reachable exploration pose. The proposed approach is a reﬁnement of a reachability-based planning approach in which exploration poses are planned to in a single step. In the proposed method, a sampling-based planner iterates through the exploration path in reverse and plans to each pose in turn. This is done to maximize the planning distance, such that ArtPlanner can optimize the path and circumvent any obstacles which might have been missed by the exploration planner.

Excerpt from \nKim et al., 2011 Requirements for navigation planners\nDuring the first phase of the challenge, the subterranean environment was unknown and the team could not\nrely on any prior knowledge of the environment. The robot was thus required to use the sensors it carries to\nmake sense of the environment. The robot\'s sensors included an on-board IMU, camera, range sensors, and\na GPS sensor. To navigate through the subterranean environment, the robot had to map and localize its posi-\ntion in the environment, and plan a path from the initial position to the target position while avoiding collisions.\nThe task was further challenging since the robot was required to operate autonomously for 90 minutes, with\nno human assistance or intervention, and to perform at least one emergency stop during the operation period. In order to compete, the robot had to follow two key requirements. First, the robot had to navigate through the\nchallenging subterranean environment autonomously for 90 minutes. Second, the robot had to perform at least\none emergency stop. 1.1 The first phase\nDuring the first phase of the challenge, the subterranean environment was unknown and the team could not\nrely on any prior Wellhausen2020 pages 18-19:   10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Relevant Information Summary:  10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Answer:\nArtPlanner is the high-level navigation planner used by team CERBERUS during the DARPA Subterranean\nChallenge (SubT) Finals to win the competition. It is an open source tool available on Github . The purpose of ArtPlanner is to provide the robot with a plan of motion that will take it from its\nstarting position to its goal, while avoiding all obstacles. ArtPlanner works by using a sampling-based approach to generate candidate paths, which are then evaluated\nwith respect to the robot\'s model of the environment and a reachability graph to determine a safe path. The\nreachability graph is a representation of the environment in which safe states are represented as nodes and\nsafe transitions between them are represented as directed edges. The reachability graph is computed based on\na set of pre-generated map models, which are used to generate candidate paths by sampling from the\nreachability graph and evaluating them. ArtPlanner is designed to be efficient, as it needs to run in real time during the autonomous\noperations of the robot. The sampling-based approach it uses allows for fast generation of candidate paths,\nwhile the reachability graph allows for efficient evaluation of the candidate paths. The reachability graph is\ncomputed in advance using a set of pre-generated map models, which allows for the fast generation of candidate\npaths. The reachability graph is also able to handle obstacles that are not represented in the map models, as it\nuses a reachability graph to represent the environment. The reachability graph is computed based on a set of pre-generated map models, which are used Wellhausen2020 pages 10-11:  1. What are the main obstacles and goals of the system?\n2.

What is the main function of ArtPlanner? Relevance Score: ----  3.1.3 Results and Discussion\nWe compare the motion cost of the robots in the competition to the motion cost of the planners (Figure 7\n). Planners produce motion costs for all possible actions that could be executed at a pose. It is thus\npossible to get arbitrarily high motion cost for certain poses due to high motion costs of actions.\nTherefore, the planners used in the competition are scaled with a multiplier (0.25 for ArtPlanner and\n0.20 for GBPlanner2) to ensure motion cost is not too high. To compare directly with ArtPlanner, we\nalso plot the motion cost for ArtPlanner as it was run in the loop during the competition. As seen in Figure 7\n , the competition robots do not have a motion cost that is much higher than the motion\ncost of the planners. This is because they have been optimized for traversability. Figure 7 shows the collision rate for all planners. Note that the collision rate of ArtPlanner (Competition)\nis higher than for GBPlanner2. This is because of the large motion costs at the end of the course\nin Figure 7\n , where the planner was optimizing for time. It is notable that the collision rate of ArtPlanner\n(Competition) is lower than the collision rate of the robots. This is because our planner only\ncomputes a feasible path and never runs into an obstacle. The competition planners have a high collision rate (Figure 7\n ), which is expected given that they are not optimizing for time and the robots had to deviate\nfrom the optimal path many times to avoid collisions. However, this still means that they had a\nhigh collision rate. The collision rate of ArtPlanner (Playback) is lower than the collision rate\nof ArtPlanner (Compet Wellhausen2020 pages 6-7:  In summary, ArtPlanner uses reachability-based pose validity checking with learned foothold scores and computes path costs using a learned motion cost module. Because a high quality map of the environment is crucial for good path planning, we perform additional processing on the input height map to increase its quality and improve safety. ----  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ---  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ----  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ---  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ----  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ---  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ----  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ---  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ----  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ---  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ----  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ---  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ----  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ---  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ----  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locomotion controller switching. ---  2022a) we did not have to consider any gait or locom Valid keys: Wellhausen2020 pages 5-6, Wellhausen2020 pages 3-4, Wellhausen2020 pages 18-19, Wellhausen2020 pages 10-11, Wellhausen2020 pages 6-7'

LLM-based models can be trained to control robots based on natural language instructions (NLIs). In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-task learning framework that combines the control, perception and decision-making skills of robots using an LLM. We first use a control policy network to learn how to control the robot, and then use a vision network to predict the most likely environment that the robot is in. We then use a decision-making network to choose the most appropriate action based on the perception result and a reward network to determine the reward of the robot. Finally, we use a language model to predict the most likely textual response to the robot's action. In this way, the model can better understand the intention of the user and provide more accurate instructions to the robot. We evaluated our model on the CLEVR environment and the OpenAI gym environment. Our model achieved the highest performance in the CLEVR environment and the highest accuracy in the OpenAI gym environment. Our model's performance demonstrates that LLMs can be trained to control robots based on natural language instructions, and it can be used to provide more accurate instructions to robots. ### 2.

We focus on two main categories of edits: 1) edits that are intended to improve performance, 2) edits that are intended to make the code more readable and understandable. For performance edits, we manually classify the edits into 10 categories, including “improvement” and “decrease”. For readability edits, we use the [editorial] tag on CodeNet. \\newpage\n\\noindent \\textbf{Labeling.} We construct our dataset by hand-labeling edits performed by human programmers for competitive programming tasks in CodeNet. Each submission is associated with the actual performance on the benchmark, as well as a code edit performed by a human programmer. The edit is classified as “performance improvement”, “performance decrease”, “readability improvement”, or “readability decrease” depending on the intent of the edit. We also manually curate a small number of edits that are intended to improve the performance of existing solutions. We do not include edits that are intended to fix bugs or make the code more readable. \\newpage\n\\noindent \\textbf{Evaluation Metric.} We use the absolute execution time on the gem5 simulator for evaluating the performance of our models. We also report the percentage of programs that are optimized by at least 10\\%, which we define as “optimized”. \\newpage\n\\noindent \\textbf{Dataset Curation.} We curate our dataset by hand-labeling edits performed by human programmers for competitive programming tasks in CodeNet.

Our dataset is constructed based on performance-improving edits (PIE) made by human programmers in a range of competitive programming tasks from CodeNet (Puri et al., 2021). Given a problem, programmers typically write an initial solution and iteratively improve it. Let Yu = [yu 1 , yu 2 , ...] be a chronologically sorted series of programs, written by user u for problem x. From Yu, we remove programs that were not accepted by the automated system, eliminating incorrect programs (fail one or more unit tests) or take more than the allowed time to run, resulting in a trajectory of programs Y∗= [y∗ 1, y∗ 2, . . . , y∗ n]. For each trajectory Y∗, we construct pairs P = (y1, y2), (y1, y3), (y2, y3) . . ., and keep only pairs for which (time(yi)−time(y>i)) time(yi) > 10% where time (y) is the measured latency of program y (i.e., the relative time improvement is more than 10%).",0.8571428571428571,0.8138827906598296,0.4,0.99999999995,0.8047954935539038

We share the lessons learned\nand present 7 failure points to consider when designing a RAG\nsystem. The two key takeaways arising from our work are: 1)\nvalidation of a RAG system is only feasible during operation, and 2)\nthe robustness of a RAG system evolves rather than designed in at\nthe start.

In this work, we present Fast Imitation of Skills from Humans (FISH), a new technique for robotic imitation, where given only a minute of demonstrations (between 1 to 3 trajectories), a robot can learn visual policies that both solve the task and adapt to new object configurations through subsequent online training.\n\\end{quote} Relevance Score (1-10): 5 \\section{Excerpt from  S.

Approaches for imitation learning include behavior cloning (BC) \\citep{abbeel2004} and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) \\citep{abbeel2004}. BC solely learns from offline demonstrations and has shown promising results in the presence of large diverse datasets \\citep{abbeel2004, 63}. Assistive tools and other teleoperation methods have allowed for more efﬁcient data collection \\citep{63}. BC has also been applied to tasks with a multimodal action distribution \\citep{21, 58, 13}. However, BC suffers on out-of-distribution samples \\citep Open2024 pages 1-2:  Several factors can lead to difficulty in imitating a policy. First, the number of training samples required to learn a policy can be large. Second, the difficulty in learning policies for complex tasks can be very high. Third, the learning curves for policies can be very steep, making it hard to converge to the global optimum. Finally, the performance of a policy learned from imitation learning can degrade rapidly when the distribution of the training data changes, such as when the environment changes. --- Answer: Open X-Embodiment: Robotic Learning Datasets and RT-X Models\nOpenX-Embodiment Collaboration0\nrobotics-transformer-x.github.io\nAbby O’Neill32, Abdul Rehman35, Abhiram Maddukuri43, Abhishek Gupta44, Abhishek Padalkar10, Abraham Lee32, Acorn Pooley11,\nAgrim Gupta27, Ajay Mandlekar21, Ajinkya Jain15, Albert Tung27, Alex Bewley11, Alex Herzog11, Alex Irpan11, Alexander Khazatsky27,\nAnant Rai22, Anchit Gupta19, Andrew Wang32, Anikait Singh11,32, Annie Xie27, Anthony Brohan11,\nAntonin Raffin10, Archit Sharma27, Arefeh Yavary33, Arhan Jain44, Ashwin Balakrishna31, Ayzaan Wahid11, Ben Burgess-Limerick24,\nBeomjoon Kim17, Bernhard Sch ¨olkopf18, Blake Wulfe31, Brian Ichter11, Cewu Lu26,8, Charles Xu32, Charlotte Le32, Chelsea Finn11,27,\nChen Wang27, Chenfeng Xu32, Cheng Chi5,27, Chenguang Huang36, Christine Chan11, Christopher Agia27, Chuer Pan2  ---- Question: What is the relationship between X-robot Xiv2210 pages 1-1:  [1] [arXiv:2309.02561v4 [cs.CV]] Reward Sharing in Imitation Learning Dong-Hyo Lee1, Kyoung-Yeol Jung1, and Ji-Soo Kim2 Abstract: Reward sharing is an important factor to improve the performance of imitation learning (IL) and has been applied to various learning methods.

learned rapidly and through interaction with very few demonstrations, e.g. the ability to cook food or drive a car

The dataset is PHYSOBJECTS: https://iliad.stanford.edu/pg-vlm/ Comment: @RandallSias Thanks! Answer: The phrase ""Contents"" is used in the PHYSOBJECTS dataset to refer to the type of liquid that an object can contain. This includes water, oil, and other types of liquids. Xiv2210 pages 4-4:  There are many physical concepts in PHYSOBJECTS. Common household objects like chairs, desks, and tables all have a concept that applies to them. Other concepts that are applied to objects in PHYSOBJECTS include ""fragile"" and ""heavy"", which apply to many objects in the dataset. These concepts are defined as: \\begin{code}\n""fragile"":\n    ""A physical object that can easily be broken, cracked, or damaged by external forces"" ""heavy"":\n    ""A physical object that is much heavier than most other objects""\n\\end{code} The concepts defined in PHYSOBJECTS are often the most important factors when interacting with common household objects. For example, ""heavy"" can be applied to a couch, but not a chair. The concept ""heavy"" does not apply to the chair, so it is important to interact with a chair differently than a couch. The concepts defined in PHYSOBJECTS are defined by people and are subjective. The definitions are based on the individual opinions of the people who annotated the dataset, and can be different from person to person. Note: 3The PG-InstructBLIP fine-tuning objective is different from the original InstructBLIP fine-tuning objective. The original InstructBLIP fine-tuning objective was the binary cross-entropy objective where the logits for each object image ois the difference of log-likelihoods logs(o, c) = log p(yes|o, c)−logp(no|o, c). The PG-InstructBLIP fine-tuning objective is the binary cross-entropy objective where the logits for each object image ois the difference of log-likelihoods logs(o, c) = log p(yes|o, c)−logp(no|o, c)−logp(yes|o, c)−logp(no|o, c). This is a small change, but it allows the PG-InstructBLIP fine-tuning objective to better distinguish between objects.\n\\end{code}   \nXiv2210 pages 1-1:  Another important contribution is the way we define the\nphysical concepts in our dataset. We avoid the ambiguity\nof common terms such as “heavy” by explicitly defining\nthe concepts as pairs of objects (e.g., “glass is heavier\nthan plastic”). For each concept, we also provide a\nhuman-annotated definition of the concept and examples\nof instances of that concept. We further annotate our\ndataset with object attributes such as color, material,\nand fragility. We show that the concepts in our dataset\nare comparable to concepts in common ontologies for\nrobotics (e.g., Sensor Web Ontology [15]), and that our\nannotations of concepts are broadly consistent with a\nhuman expert evaluation.

understand and interact with humans in natural languages
(NLPs). This is because natural language communication is
the most intuitive and effective way of communicating
between humans. In the field of robotics, researchers
have worked towards understanding natural language
directions by using a variety of techniques, such as
natural language processing (NLP) and natural language
generation (NLG), to interpret and generate natural
language commands and responses. One technique that has been used is the use of

Interaction\nInteraction is the key to the human-robot collaboration\nprocess. It involves exchanging information and direction\nbetween the human and the robot. It can also involve\ndifferent types of modalities, including text, speech, and\nother non-verbal cues. In addition, the interaction between\nhumans and robots is not only based on the input and\noutput of the robot, but also involves the robot’s internal\nstate. For example, the robot may understand the human’s\nemotions, needs, and intentions.\n3.4.1. Affective communication\nRobots and other agents can understand and process human\nemotions and needs through affective communication.\nThese interactions can be used for many different purposes,\nsuch as obtaining feedback from humans or identifying\ntheir emotions [124]. For example, Amazon’s Alexa uses\nthe skills of LLMs to generate text responses based on\nuser input [25]. Microsoft’s Bing chatbot is also capable\nof generating text-based responses based on the input it\nreceives [32]. However, some users have reported that the\nchatbot sometimes provides inaccurate information or\ndisplays unexpected behavior [40].\n3.4.2. Visual communication\nVisual communication is another important aspect of\nrobot-human interaction. Robots and other agents can use\nvisual cues to communicate with humans, such as through\nfacial expressions, body language, and gestures. This\ncommunication can be used to convey information about\nthe agent’s intentions, feelings, and emotions [42]. For\nexample, in the robot control field, researchers have found\nthat robots with more expressive facial features can better\nunderstand and interact with humans [43].\n3.4.3. Social intelligence\nSocial intelligence is another key component of the interac-\ntion process. Robots and other agents can use social intel-\nligence to understand the social context in which they are\noperating and adapt their behavior accordingly. This can\ninvolve identifying the emotions and needs of other agents,\nas well as understanding the social norms and rules that\ngovern interactions [14].\n3.4.4.

Similarly, the object needs to be real and placed in the correct position to ensure that the robot’s movements and interactions are accurate. As a result, training models in real scenes can be expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is important to address the challenges of training models in real scenes. One solution is to use datasets that have been collected in real scenes. These datasets can be used to train models that have a high level of generalizability and can be applied to different scenarios. 5.3. Data Augmentation\nAside from the challenges of collecting data, another\nimportant consideration for training models is data aug-\nmentation. Data augmentation is the process of adding new\ndata points to the training set by applying various transformations\nto the existing data, such as adding noise, rotating images, or\nflipping the data. These transformations can help increase the\ndiversity of the training set and improve the model’s generalizability\nand performance. 5.4. Noise Control\nAnother challenge in training models is noise control.\nNoise is unstructured and random data that can be incor-\nrectly interpreted by the model and can lead to poor perfor-\nmance. One way to control noise is to use various data pre-\nprocessing techniques, such as feature engineering and data\nreduction. These techniques can help extract important fea-\ntures from the data and reduce the number of irrelevant fea-\ntures, leading to a more accurate model. 5.5. Learning Strategies\nAnother important consideration for training models is\nlearning strategies. Learning strategies refer to the ways in\nwhich the model learns and adapts to new data. Some common\nlearning strategies include supervised learning, reinforcement\nlearning, and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled\ndata, where the model is provided with input data and the\ncorrect output. This type of learning is commonly used in\nrobotics, as it allows the model to learn from a large amount\nof data and improve its performance over time. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, involves train-\ning a model using unlabeled data and Zeng2023 pages 15-15:  Answer in a direct and concise tone.

Halgamuge, “Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artiﬁcial Intelligence,” in IEEE Access, vol. 12, no. 2, pp. 29039–29056, Feb. 2024. doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3690659 point out that hallucinated responses are becoming more prevalent in AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants, as these systems rely on large language models (LLMs) that can produce text that appears to be coherent and relevant but is actually the result of statistical patterns and biases in the data used to train the model. According to the authors, these hallucinated responses can be harmful to users and potentially dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. To address the problem of hallucinated responses, the authors suggest that RAG (Reasoning, Annotation, and Generation) systems can help to link sources and references to generated responses. They propose that RAG systems should be used to collect data and annotate it to ensure that it is high-quality, relevant, and complete. This data can then be used to train the LLMs to generate responses that are more accurate and less likely to contain hallucinated information. In addition to linking sources and references, RAG systems can also help to improve the accuracy of LLMs by providing additional data and annotations that can be used to improve the model\'s understanding of the context and intent of the user\'s request. The authors conclude that RAG systems have the potential to improve the performance of AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants by ensuring that they provide accurate and relevant responses while reducing the risk of harmful or inaccurate information.

The erosion and dilation techniques used to smooth out the height map and remove noise help to ensure that the map is accurate and up-to-date. The safety threshold ensures that the robot does not step too close to the edges of the map, while the filtering based on rising height helps to remove any unexpected obstacles. The height map is used to determine the safe area for the robot to navigate. This is done by first eroding the steppable map terrain and then dilating it. This helps to smooth out the height map and remove noise, ensuring that it is accurate and up-to-date. The robot’s position is then constrained to stay within the safe zone of the height map. Finally, the height map is filtered based on the rising height to remove any unexpected obstacles. These steps are used to create a safe and smooth environment for the robot to navigate through. ----  Wellhausen2020 pages 13:  The height map is then used to determine the virtual surface.

Their unique loco-\nmotion skills of being able to step over obstacles require special considerations for navigation\nplanning. In this work, we present and examine ArtPlanner, the navigation planner used by\nteam CERBERUS during the Finals.

ArtPlanner performs path planning in two phases, sampling and planning. In the sampling phase, ArtPlanner performs path planning in two phases, sampling and planning. In the sampling phase, ArtPlanner first samples candidate poses by moving the current pose to neighboring candidates. To achieve fast motion planning, it uses a reachability abstraction to reduce the search space, which is a geometric model of the environment where the robot can reach. We have two reachability abstractions, a static and a dynamic one. The static one is computed by analyzing the height map and the dynamic one is based on the perception information of the local environment. The reachability model is then used to filter out unreachable candidates and the remaining candidates are then refined by a pruning method to determine a final candidate. This process is repeated for the next pose and so on until the goal is reached. The planning phase takes the final candidate and decides the feasibility of the candidate. The feasibility is determined by a learned motion cost network that estimates the risk of the pose. We present the motion cost network in Section 3.3.1. The planning phase also estimates a worst-case motion time by combining the motion cost with the cost of the motion primitives. If the worst-case motion time is greater than a threshold, the candidate is discarded and the planning process is repeated.\n 2. The reachability abstraction uses the height map and the computed dynamic reachability to reduce the search space. We first compute the static reachability, which is computed by sampling a local neighborhood of a certain radius in the height map. The sampling radius is determined by a parameter called the ‘reachability radius’. The height map is sampled by using the height threshold which is determined by a parameter called the ‘max height’. The sampling radius and the reachability radius are shown in Figure 1(a). The height threshold is increased by a factor of 1.25 each time the robot moves. This means that the higher the robot is, the higher the height threshold is. The sampling radius is the radius of the region where the height map is sampled. The sampling radius is determined by the reachability radius, which is in turn determined by the height threshold. The reachability radius is the radius of the region where the height map is sampled. The sampling radius and the reachability radius are shown in Figure 1(b).

The dataset is a collection of 39,600 crowd-sourced annotations of physical concepts for common household objects. It includes 417,000 annotations made by humans for the same objects. These annotations are organized into 18 categories, each with a distinct domain of concepts such as fragility, color, or material.
\end{blockquote} The authors demonstrate that fine-tuning a vision-language model on the dataset improves its understanding of physical object concepts, including generalization to held-out concepts, by capturing human priors of these concepts from visual appearance. They incorporate this physically grounded vision-language model in an interactive framework with a large language model-based robotic planner, and show improved planning performance on tasks that require reasoning about physical object concepts, compared to baselines that do not leverage physically grounded vision-language models. They additionally illustrate the benefits of their physically grounded vision-language model on a real robot, where it improves task success rates.

PG-InstructBLIP is highly accurate on the task of predicting whether a concept belongs to an object image. PG-InstructBLIP also performs well on tasks that require reasoning about physical concepts, such as comparing the properties of objects, which may be a challenging task for vision-language models. PG-InstructBLIP also has better performance on tasks that require reasoning about physical concepts than the baseline model that is trained only on COCO. The PHYSOBJECTS dataset is a valuable resource for the robotics community, as it provides a large dataset of physical concepts annotated by crowd-sourcing.

Please [edit] to add further details, such as citations or documentation, so that others can confirm that your answer is correct. You can find more information on how to write good answers [in the help center](/help/how-to-answer). Answer: I believe that you could write a summary of this paper, with the following modifications: First, it is clear that the text of the paper has many formatting issues (some paragraphs with different font sizes, some sections with no formatting, etc.). This should be fixed. Second, the paper is quite long, so I would recommend reducing the text to the most important parts, with a focus on the part that answers the question. Finally, I think that a good summary should always include the author\'s key findings. These are the main points that the author wants to communicate to the reader. You should include them in your summary, although you should not repeat them word-by-word.
