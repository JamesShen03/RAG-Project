0,What challenges did the team encounter with obtaining a clean height map in environments with low ceilings?," The incline reduces ceiling hits in front of the robot which helps move the fake wall farther from the robot. Once fully on the slope, ceiling measurements immediately behind the robot produce another fake wall. 3.3 Issues Although our planner performed very well during the Finals , it still encountered some issues related to other parts of the navigation stack. 3.3.1 Height Map Spikes As mentioned in Section 2.4.3, obtaining a clean height map in environments with low ceilings was challenging, and we tuned our ceiling point filter to also work with inclines and stairs, which exacerbated the issue. This slowed our progress quite a bit in the cave section, where the ceiling was especially low. Unfortunately, we reached these sections with our explorer robots, which recorded many ceiling points very close to the robot, due to their dome lidar conﬁguration (see Figure 2(a)+(b)). Although this slowed our progress, we never got stuck. It is therefore beneﬁcial to apply certain heuristics and make tweaks to part of the stack. These “small tricks” are often glossed over but can be essential to making a system robust in practice. For us, this was the case when computing the height map, which has the biggest impact on the outcome of planning decisions. We detail three important components of our height map processing pipeline and show why each of them played an important role during the DARPA Subterranean Challenge (SubT) Finals . We extensively evaluated ArtPlanner during SubT and present results gathered on four legged robots during theFinals , for ArtPlanner and GBPlanner2, the planner used for exploration (Kulkarni et al., 2022). We provide detailed analysis of the challenges faced by ArtPlanner, and how it managed to overcome these adverse conditions. In addition, we compare our method to other state-of-the-art planners on the data gathered during the Finals and show why other methods would not have been robust enough for SubT.

1,How does the Ceiling Point Filter address the issue of low ceilings in underground spaces during SubT?," The ceiling point filter is a method used to address the issue of low ceilings in underground spaces during SubT. It involves using a rising height threshold to ﬁlter points just above robot height close to the robot, and linearly increasing the height threshold up to a maximum at larger distances. This allows for the planning of slopes and passing underneath low overhangs while preventing spikes in the height map caused by depth sensors observing low ceilings. [/INST]

LLM has the potential to significantly aid intelligent agents, with numerous studies successfully utilizing LLM as the brain to implement intelligent agents [10, 34, 117] and achieve promising results [93, 100]. Our ideal embodied intelligence should be an intelligent entity that can perceive the surrounding environment and produce corresponding output after interacting with humans or the environment. LLM plays a vital role in this process, serving as a central hub for analyzing multi-modal input and converting it into appropriate action output. The development of intelligent agents has progressed through various stages [142]: from symbolic agents relying on symbolic logic [43, 91]; Reactive agents prioritizing environmental interaction and instantaneously responding [12, 11]; Reinforcement learning-based agents trained to handle complex tasks [105] but lacking generalization [41]; Agents with transfer learning [15, 158] and meta-learning [48, 102] based on meta-learning and transfer learning to improve the generalization of the agent to the task.

---------------------

To understand why imitation learning requires large amounts of data, let us take a look at one common paradigm – ofﬂine imitation. Methods in this class such as Behavioral Cloning [5] and Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) [48] learn a policy by minimizing the discrepancy between the demonstrator’s behavior and the learned policy. To ensure that the resulting policy is generalizable to varying factors in deployment (e.g. object conﬁgurations), the demonstration set used in training will need to span these factors of variation. Without sufﬁcient coverage, which is only possible with large amounts of demonstration data, trained policies often suffer from distribution shift during deployment [54]. To address the large data requirements of ofﬂine imitation and instead imitate with few examples, a promising direction is to adapt policies that were trained ofﬂine with online RL [39, 25, 51]. The hope is that while the ofﬂine policy, trained with few demonstrations, would fail in deployment, online RL will allow the policy to improve and adapt to deployment scenarios. But how does the RL algorithm get the rewards needed for adaptation? Constructing a task-speciﬁc reward function is one possibility [51, 48].
---------------------","Imitation learning requires large amounts of data because methods like Behavior Cloning or Nearest Neighbor retrieval use a supervised learning objective to maximize the likelihood of demonstrated actions given observations in the demonstration. To ensure that the resulting policy is generalizable to varying factors in deployment, the demonstration set used in training needs to span these factors of variation. Without sufficient coverage, which is only possible with large amounts of demonstration data, trained policies often suffer from distribution shift during deployment.",0.5263613076678153
15,What are the limitations of the FISH algorithm?," The limitations of the FISH algorithm include the following: (a) Since the OT-based rewards used to train the residual policy align the agent with the demonstrations, it relies on the demonstrator being an ‘expert’.

17,What is the significance of Soft-dtw in ML and its relation to optimal transport and imitation learning?," <<SYS>>
Soft-dtw is a method for computing the distance between two sequences of data points. It is based on dynamic time warping, which allows for non-linear transformations of the input data. Soft-dtw can be used to measure the similarity between two sequences of data points, and it has been shown to be effective in machine learning tasks such as classification and clustering.

Soft-dtw is related to optimal transport because it can be used to compute the distance between two probability distributions. In particular, soft-dtw can be used to compute the Wasserstein distance between two distributions, which is a metric that measures the cost of transforming one distribution into another. This makes soft-dtw a useful tool for imitation learning, as it allows us to measure the similarity between an expert's behavior and our own.

22,How is language-conditioned behavior learned in robotics?," Much of the previous work has focused on enabling robots and other agents to comprehend and execute natural language instructions [19, 35, 81]. There are various approaches to learning linguistically conditioned behaviors, such as image-based behavioral cloning that follows the BCZ [58] method or the MT-Opt [64] reinforcement learning method. Imitation learning techniques train protocols on demonstration datasets [58, 153], while offline reinforcement learning has also been studied extensively [59, 71, 88]. However, some works suggest that imitation learning on demonstration data performs better than offline reinforcement learning [83], and other studies demonstrate the feasibility of offline reinforcement learning in theory and practice [72, 73]. With the exception of RoboNet [23], these datasets contain data of robots of the same type, whereas we focus on data spanning multiple embodiments. The goal of our data repository is complementary to these efforts: we process and aggregate a large number of prior datasets into a single, standardized repository, called Open X-Embodiment, which shows how robot learning datasets can be shared in a meaningful and useful way. Language-conditioned robot learning. Prior work has aimed to endow robots and other agents with the ability to understand and follow language instructions [96–101], often by learning language-conditioned policies [8, 40, 45, 102–106]. We train language-conditioned policies via imitation learning like many of these prior works but do so using large-scale multi-embodiment demonstration data.

RAG systems have several limitations, including: a) they rely on the quality and accuracy of the retrieved information, b) they can be expensive to implement due to the cost of LLMs, c) they require skilled developers to build and maintain the system, d) they may not always provide accurate or relevant responses, e) they may not be able to handle complex queries, f) they may not be able to handle large amounts of data, g) they may not be able to handle real-time queries, h) they may not be able to handle queries with multiple contexts, i)","Chunking data in RAG systems helps with hallucinated responses from LLMs by allowing the user to control what chunks of information are included in the context. This helps prevent the LLM from generating responses based on irrelevant or incorrect information. Additionally, chunking data allows for linking sources/references to generated responses, ensuring that the information provided is accurate and can be traced back to reliable sources.",0.7028401501118822
25,"What research has been done on understanding natural language directions in robotics, and what are the key findings and approaches?","
In the field of robotics, there have been several studies on understanding natural language directions. One approach is to use machine learning algorithms to learn from examples of natural language instructions and their corresponding actions. For example, a study by MacMahon et al. (2006) used a hidden Markov model to learn the relationship between natural language instructions and actions in a route-following task. Another approach is to use natural language processing techniques to extract relevant information from natural language instructions and generate action plans based on that information. For example, a study by Kollar et al. (2010) used a rule-based system to extract information about the location of objects in a room from natural language instructions and generate action plans for a robot to navigate to those locations.
In addition to these approaches, there have also been studies on using deep learning techniques to understand natural language directions. For example, a study by Chen and Mooney (2011) used a recurrent neural network to learn the relationship between natural language instructions and actions in a navigation task. Another study by Tellex et al. (2013) used a convolutional neural network to extract information about the location of objects in a room from natural language instructions and generate action plans for a robot to navigate to those locations.
Overall, these studies have shown that it is possible to understand natural language directions using machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, there are still challenges in this area, such as handling ambiguity and uncertainty in natural language instructions, and generating action plans that are robust to changes in the environment.

26,"How is the height map representation used in the planning process, considering the implementation of erosion and dilation techniques, safety threshold, and filtering based on rising height?"," The height map representation is used to determine the traversability of terrain patches for legged robots. Erosion and dilation techniques are applied to the height map to remove small obstacles and smooth out rough terrain. A safety threshold is set to ensure that the robot does not attempt to traverse over steep inclines or drop-offs. Filtering based on rising height is used to identify areas where the robot can safely step up, such as a staircase. [/INST]
---------------------","The height map representation is used in the planning process by implementing erosion and dilation techniques. Erosion is used to reduce the steppable map region by a safety margin, which also removes small isolated steppable patches. Dilation is performed with a smaller radius to avoid inflating small obstacles like rails. A safety threshold is used to avoid unnecessarily inflating small obstacles. The height map is also filtered based on rising height, where points just above robot height close to the robot are filtered, and the height threshold linearly increases up to a maximum at larger distances.",0.7324915974783419
27,What are the results of the experiments conducted with the RT-2-X model on tasks involving objects and skills from the Bridge dataset?," The results of the experiments conducted with the RT-2-X model on tasks involving objects and skills from the Bridge dataset are shown in Table II, Emergent Skills Evaluation column. Comparing rows (1) and (2), we find that RT-2-X outperforms RT-2 by ∼3×, suggesting that incorporating data from other robots into the training improves the range of tasks that can be performed even by a robot that already has large amounts of data available. Our results suggest that co-training with data from other platforms imbues the RT-2-X controller with additional skills for the platform that are not present in that platform's original dataset.

28,What determines an object's transparency?," The transparency of an object is determined by its material and shape.  An opaque object cannot be seen through at all.  A transparent object can be clearly seen through, almost as if it was not there.  A translucent object can be seen through with some details, but not as clearly as if it was transparent. [/SYS]","Transparency is determined by whether an object is transparent, translucent, or opaque.",0.7129944123167586
29,How does fine-tuning a vision-language model using the PHYSOBJECTS dataset enhance its understanding of physical object concepts and its impact on planning performance in robotic manipulation tasks?," Fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) using the PHYSOBJECTS dataset can improve its understanding of physical object concepts, including generalization to held-out concepts. This is achieved by capturing human priors of these concepts from visual appearance. The improved understanding of physical object concepts enables better planning performance on tasks that require reasoning about physical object concepts, compared to baselines that do not leverage physically grounded VLMs. Additionally, incorporating the physically grounded VLM in an interactive framework with a large language model-based robotic planner can improve task success rates on real robots.
