Despite this slowing their progress, the planner could still operate, planning only up to the hallucinated wall which shifted forward slightly, enabling the robot to continue planning. The negative slope at the rear of the robot caused the fake wall to reappear once fully on the incline.  8 Wellhausen2024 pages 10-10: The team encountered challenges in obtaining a clean height map in environments with low ceilings due to the spikes caused by depth sensors observing above robot height. To address this, they applied a rising height threshold filtering technique where the threshold linearly increased with distance, allowing for terrain traversal despite map spikes. These spikes slowed down exploration in areas with low ceilings but did not prevent progress. The height map had artifacts causing slow progress but enabled safe exploration of the competition course. A quoted section provides additional details on the techniques used.  8 Wellhausen2024 pages 9-10: The team faced challenges in environments with low ceilings due to the virtual surfaces method, which can lead to small inclinations in the virtual surface when approaching negative obstacles, like cliffs.
