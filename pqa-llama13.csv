The use of image erosion allows the robot to plan up slopes and underneath very low overhangs, even when encountered together, as discussed in Wellhausen2022 pages 17-18 (8). However, it can cause slow progression due to artifacts in the height map, as noted in Wellhausen2022 pages 22-23 (8).","['Wellhausen2022 pages 17-18:  The height map implementation in the navigation planner uses virtual surfaces to avoid negative obstacles.

The virtual surfaces allowed the robot to plan up the incline, reach the platform, and score the cube artifact, as shown in Figure 11(c).

Furthermore, training LLMs require vast amounts of data to support their capabilities, particularly high-quality datasets that consume considerable resources (Zeng2024 pages 12-12). In the field of robotics, collecting datasets is even more difficult due to the need for multimodal data, such as text, images, and touch, to serve as the robot's sensory input (Zeng2024 pages 12-12). However, policy control is necessary, which includes the interaction between the robot and its environment, necessitating 3D data (Zeng2024 pages 12-12).

Huang et al. proposed using LLMs/VLMs to extract the knowledge of movable area [45]. These studies indeed define Affordance as a form of Gibson’s Affordance; however, focusing on the relationship between the working environment, the objects being manipulated, and the robot, it can be considered that object manipulation involves even more constraints [46]. For example, the notion of affordance can be extended to waypoints for collision avoidance [47], grasp types [48], and upper-limb postures [49]. This information is often not taught explicitly, thus vision systems need to extract it from human teaching demonstrations.

LASTER is grounded in a high-fidelity, physics-based simulator and tracked by a low-level joint position control (PDC) controller. The application of LASTER in robotics includes enabling walking on flat ground and uneven terrain, as demonstrated by the A1 quadruped robot. The effectiveness of LASTER is evaluated by various LLMs, with GPT-4 being the most powerful enough to in-context learn a robot walking behavior using the designed prompt.

In recent years, the Control Transformer (CT) has been proposed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of robot navigation in complex environments. CT utilizes a sample-based probabilistic roadmap planner to generate conditional sequences from low-level policies, allowing it to complete navigation tasks solely through local observations. In addition, Q-Transformer has been proposed to integrate reinforcement learning and Transformer, enabling the exploitation of Q-values for each dimension. This allows for the utilization of large and diverse robot datasets, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the reinforcement learning process.

According to the excerpt on Wang2401 pages 4-5, increased lengths of observations and actions positively correlate with enhanced performance . Normalization of observation and action prompts is also crucial. Different normalization methods have varying effects on the performance of LLMs. For instance, normalizing the observation prompt to positive values improves the performance (Wang2401 pages 5-6). The excerpt on Wang2401 pages 6-6 reports that E3 (normalize to integer values) and E5 (normalize to positive integer values) result in the lowest normalized walking times (Example2012Example pages 1-1).
