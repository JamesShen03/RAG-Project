This process reduces the steppable map region, allowing the planner to focus on traversable areas.

The virtual surfaces analysis showed that the height map contained many holes in front of the robot, which reduced the size of the steppable area. The planner could only plan up the incline once the ceiling point filter reduced the height map spikes.

The filter struggled to accurately estimate the height of the robot in environments with low ceilings, leading to potential collisions (Section 20-21). Inclines and stairs posed additional challenges as the filter needed to adapt to changing terrain heights. The filter's rising height threshold caused points just above the robot height close to the robot to be filtered, but it did not discard all points above a fixed height, allowing the robot to pass underneath low overhangs and plan up slopes (Section 10). However, the filter's maximum height threshold increased linearly with distance, causing crucial slowdowns (Section 10).","[""Wellhausen2015 pages 17-18:  The ceiling point filter encountered challenges in low-ceiling environments, particularly with inclines and stairs. The excerpt mentions that the filter tuned to work with inclines and stairs, which exacerbated the issue (Section 3.3.1). The height map spikes were slowing their progress in the cave section, where the ceiling was especially low (Section 3.3.1).

In Table XVI, we compare including object category labels or not, and find that all models are not extremely sensitive to this. While we did not spend extensive effort designing the question prompts for each concept, we aimed for them to be concise while still eliciting the desired concept. The base InstructBLIP model achieves above chance performance on all concepts, suggesting that these prompts do elicit the desired concept to some extent. However, these prompts do not contain our definitions for each concept provided to annotators. We analyze whether including concept definitions in the question prompt would improve base VLM performance, but find that it does not match PG-InstructBLIP on these concepts, and overall performance actually decreases compared to the original prompts. We believe this could be because InstructBLIP does not have strong enough language understanding to properly incorporate the concept definitions when providing responses. For this reason, and for simplicity, we use prompts without concept definitions in the evaluation of PG-InstructBLIP.",1.0,1.0000000000000007,1.0,0.99999999995,0.42138648977749793

Overall, the excerpt provides evidence that an object\'s transparency is determined by its material composition. Relevance Score: 9 Gao2024 pages 9-9:  The excerpt defines the concept of transparency for objects and containers, indicating it as a categorical value determined by observers based on what can be seen through the object. According to the excerpt, the level of transparency is determined by the observer\'s perspective, with specific options provided for transparent, translucent, opaque, and unknown . The excerpt does not provide direct evidence on how the transparency level is determined, but it does establish the concept as a subjective, observer-dependent value. Relevance Score (on a newline): 8 Gao2024 pages 25-25:  From the excerpt, it can be inferred that an object\'s transparency is determined by its material properties, such as the type of plastic it is made of. For example, in the fifth task instruction, "" Put all objects that are not plastic to the side,"" it suggests that the planner can distinguish between objects made of plastic and those made of other materials based on their transparency. Additionally, in table XXIII, the object category labels given by OWL-ViT are sometimes inaccurate or ambiguous, and in those cases, more precise labels are provided in square brackets, which further supports the idea that an object\'s transparency can be determined by its material properties. Relevance Score: 8 Gao2024 pages 15-16:  The excerpt explains that an object\'s transparency refers to how much can be seen through it. It is defined as a property of objects, and its level can vary depending on the object\'s material. The excerpt also mentions that the transparency of an object does not refer to the contents of a container if it has anything inside it. The study provided in the excerpt does not provide a clear answer to the question on what determines an object\'s transparency, but it suggests that the object\'s material plays a significant role in determining its transparency level.

132,How does fine-tuning a vision-language model using the PHYSOBJECTS dataset enhance its understanding of physical object concepts and its impact on planning performance in robotic manipulation tasks?," Fine-tuning a vision-language model using the PHYSOBJECTS dataset enhances its understanding of physical object concepts by providing a diverse set of annotated objects with varying shapes, sizes, and textures (Gao2024 pages 6-7). This enhancement is achieved through the binary cross-entropy objective function, which improves the model's performance on the PHYSOBJECTS dataset compared to the baseline model (Gao2024 pages 4-4). The fine-tuned model demonstrates improved planning accuracy on real scenes and task success rate on a real robot (Gao2024 pages 5-5). The results suggest that grounding the LLM with physical objects using PHYSOBJECTS improves its reasoning ability, leading to better planning performance in robotic manipulation tasks (Gao2024 pages 1-2).
